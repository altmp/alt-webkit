Building EA WebKit
------------------

This version supports Win32, Win64, XBox One and PS4 platforms.

EA WebKit requires that you have proper development tools installed.  Contact your platform providers to install the proper SDKs.

It is recomended to unzip these files to as shallow a location on your hard-drive as possible. EAWebKit has a deep directory structure and you may run into OS path-size limits that prevent a successful build if it is installed in too deep a directory.
