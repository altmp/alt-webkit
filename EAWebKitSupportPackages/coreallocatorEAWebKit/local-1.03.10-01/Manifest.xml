	<description>
		ICoreAllocator defines an abstract interface for dynamic memory
		allocation.  It consists of two variations of alloc and one free
		function.  Specialized versions of operator new and new[] are
		also provided.  This interface will be used by Next Generation
		Ignition technologies.

		No implementation of the interface is provided in this package;
		users are expected to supply their own.  We encourage the use
		of the PPMalloc allocator.
