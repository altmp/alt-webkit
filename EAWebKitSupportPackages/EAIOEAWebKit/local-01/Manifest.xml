	<description>
		This package implements portable file and stream IO similar to 
		that provided in desktop file system and path manipulation APIs.
		As of 10/2006, this package is gradually being migrated from the 
		EAFile* functionality in the UTFFoundation package. A future
		version of EAIO should have all the file functionality moved 
		from UTFFoundation.
